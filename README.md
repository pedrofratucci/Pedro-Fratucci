# About me
**Personal life**

As my bio says, I live a truly happy life. Sharing it with my family, girlfriend, friends and cats.


**Professional career**

I'm a mechanical engineer graduated from UFRGS in 2020. I've been programming since 2017. 

I started studying data analysis in December 2020. Since then, I've been studying all stages of developing business solution models. Staring by understanding the business problem until creating models solutions, interfaces and deploying it using Clouds plataforms.

Some of my solutions so far includes detect cardiovascular diseases and detect bank transaction frauds, both by classification methods.

# Data Science Projects

### [Cardiovascular Disease Prediction](https://github.com/pedrofratucci/cardio_catch_diseases_webapp)

In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model able to detect disease in early stages with **74,60% accuracy**, over 70k patience.

This model performance, in the best case scenario, **would increase a company test profit from R$ 500,00 to R$ 2500,00.** And would substitute a manual process by a machine learning model.
